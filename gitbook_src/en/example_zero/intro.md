# Example 0 - Hello Network

In this example our objective is to create a local test network on a single machine which can later be used to test various network operations via the API project.

**Note:** This example is a must have requirement to successfully run any of the future examples as it provides the test-bed for other examples to operate on.

With that in mind, this example demonstrates a tool that should be easy to use and get the network set up with minimal effort. This tool is bundled with the MaidSafe Super project.
